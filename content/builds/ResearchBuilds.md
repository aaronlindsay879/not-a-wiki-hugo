    - name: Notes for R16
      notes:
        - There is a relevant guide on how to go through the unlocking of the
          researches needed to start using research builds.
          (<a target="_blank" href="http://musicfamily.org/realm/R16Guide/"><b>R16 Research Guide</b></a>)
        - "IMPORTANT: Although you unlock all researches at the end of R16, you do not use research until R17. Keep using Mercenary to finish R16"
        - All factions were used and tested, Goblin proved to be the best in a reasonable amount of time.

<h6><img src="/Factions/picks/TopPageResearch.png" alt="Spellcraft" align="middle"></h6>

As a general Rule: All builds were tested without Sunforce, if not stated otherwise. All builds had access to all relevant trophies, challenges and artifacts. Only the fastest build for each bracket made it into this, but every combination that looked useful (and even some others) was tested.

Vanilla Flavor Juice and Ancient Cocoa Bean are required.

All of the builds are rush builds with under 25 minutes (vanilla) or 15 minutes (neutral) runtime due to the above artifacts.

If you aren't doing so already, spend your offline or idle time as Druid (2 days of Druid time will make your life much easier in R28+, because it will unlock the strongest research available to you)

Focus on getting Vanilla Flavor Juice, Sunforce and other easy Lore artifacts with excavs (Up to R19: After getting the RPs with them)

After you unlock E290, make sure to do a last excavation run with it prior to reincarnating

**Important for R29**: Earth Core quest artifact and Secrets of the Underworld is required to unlock Prestige research. **DO NOT reincarnate into R30 before you buy Secret of The Underworld.**

At e114 gems, Secrets of the Underworld becomes reachable, unlocking Prestige research, which is not covered in this guide.
